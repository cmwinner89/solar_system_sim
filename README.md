### Background and Overview

My Javascript project is a interactive simulation of our solar system.  The simulation will visualize th current position of the 8 plaents orbiting the sun (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune).  Display in-depth details for each planet.  

### MVPS

## In solar_system_sim_js users will be able to: 

- Users can see a disaply of planets around the sun that rotate according to distant

- Users can see a display of the date/ time of current or future orbit

## In addition, this project will include: 

- Track probes such as voyager.
- track planets in different views, overview, plant view, star constellation

### Architecure and Technology 

- This application will use api provided by nasa that will give the position of the planets.  
- Use canvas to display the planets and have motion on the screen for users

### Implementation Guide line

- Day 1 - implement the api to get information for the planets
- Day 2 - use canvas to display the Mercury (more if possible) around the sun
- Day 3 - Implement the rest of the planets
- Day 4 - Grab detailed information about the planets and have it displayed on click

### Bonus features

- Display the moons orbiting the planet as well
- Add multiple displays suck as earth view and star constellations the planets are near to
